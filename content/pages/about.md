Summary:  A quick summary of Victoria Mo.  

### My values

I believe in striving to do the best that I can possibly do at whatever I am doing at each current moment. “do” includes everything within my immediate control, that is, thought, speech, and action. “best” is defined as the intersection of what I can objectively state and how I subjectively feel is the right thing to do for that particular situation. Every day I learn more about my values, my weights for each of them, and how to best apply them in practice. Some guidelines that I try to hold by are being honest to myself and to others, avoiding the 3 C’s (criticizing, condemning, complaining), and looking upon the world with soft eyes ☺.

### My programming goals

To put people at the forefront of my code. I want to build software that not only positively impacts the world around me, but also is beautiful, well-documented, and easy-to-understand.

I’m a full-stack programmer, but I especially enjoy working on hard people problems, in particular, AI/Machine Learning/making sense of big data.

Causes that especially interest me include connecting cultures through language learning, bridging the gap by opening up data visualization and machine learning techniques to non-technical users, and empowering people to believe that they can do anything, as long as they believe that they can.

### My toolbox

I’ve worked with the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language and the [Django web framework](http://djangoproject.com) extensively, but I have also built applications using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)/[Express](http://expressjs.com), RoR, and Obj-C. SQL databases are usually my go-to, but I’ve also been experimenting lately with the NoSQL database [Cassandra]( http://www.datastax.com/what-we-offer/products-services/datastax-enterprise/apache-cassandra).

Other languages: C, C++, Java, R, Matlab/Octave

### Contact

You can find my contact information (as well as some of my interests) in [my humans.txt file](/humans.txt).

I’m also a competitive fencer gunning for the national team, so if you or anyone you know has any interest in starting up, shoot me a line and I’ll tell you the best places/clubs to learn!
