Summary: Seven steps to better relax and focus


1. Good posture. Tuck the tailbone in, imagine if somebody were pulling a string from the crown of your head up into the sky. Keep the head level.

2. Relax the eyes, the face, the mouth, the jaw, the area behind the ears down to the neck, the shoulders, the arms down to the fingertips, the upper back, the middle back, the lower back, the buttocks down to the toes.

3. Breathe. Breathe into the lower stomach, expanding in all directions, while keeping the shoulders level. Focus on posture with each inhale, and focus on relaxing with each exhale.

4. Slow down time. Let every moment pass by slowly. This may result in slower, calmer breathing or slower movements, and that's more than ok.

5. Identify all fears and let them go. This includes the fear of not being able to remember all fears.

6. Confidence. Remind self that, given whatever circumstances, I will be able to do the best that I can do in each particular moment.

7. Input/output. Focus on the inputs from the world, that is, the five senses and prior knowledge. Remind self that the only outputs are speaking and moving. Therefore, choose the best action from all possibilities at this very moment, and do it.

Another method for (7) is to imagine as if you were suddenly transported into this body, with these memories and knowledge. Do what would be the best thing to do at this current moment.
